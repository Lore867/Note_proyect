# Note Taker App

A simple yet powerful web application for taking notes, with user authentication and multi-language support.

## Description

Note Taker is a Single Page Application (SPA) that allows users to sign up, log in, and manage their personal notes. The notes are securely saved in the browser's local storage, associated with each user account. The interface is clean, modern, and fully responsive.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **User Authentication**: Sign-up and login system. Each user has their own private space for notes.
*   **Full Note Management (CRUD)**:
    *   **Create**: Add new notes with a title, content, and tags.
    *   **Read**: View all your notes in a numbered list.
    *   **Update**: Edit the content of your existing notes.
    *   **Delete**: Permanently delete notes with a confirmation dialog.
*   **Archive & Unarchive**: Move notes to an "Archived" section to keep your main list clean without deleting them.
*   **Tagging System**: Organize your notes by adding comma-separated tags.
*   **Multi-language Support**: The interface can be dynamically switched between **Spanish** and **English**.
*   **Modern and Attractive Design**: An elegant interface with subtle animations and a responsive design that adapts to any device.
*   **Data Persistence**: Notes and user accounts are saved in the browser's `localStorage`, and the session is maintained with `sessionStorage`.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

*   **HTML5**: For the semantic structure of the content.
*   **CSS3**: For the design, animations, and responsive styling. It uses Flexbox and a modern layout.
